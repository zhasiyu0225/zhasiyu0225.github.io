0507 I‚Äôm Siyu Zha, an HCI researcher in Human-Computer Interaction, passionate about Human-AI collaboration and creative learning design. I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Information Art & Design at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yingqing Xu](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/yjtd/xyq/index.htm), and am a visiting Ph.D. researcher at the University of Toronto, working with Prof. [Jia Xue](https://aij.utoronto.ca/team/dr-jia-xue.html).

With a background in Educational Technology and STEM Education, my research explores how emerging technologies‚Äîespecially AI‚Äîcan empower learning experiences, support collaborative creativity, and foster lifelong learning through innovative, interdisciplinary design.

I‚Äôve contributed to a range of projects in the fields of AI in education, STEAM curriculum design, and future learning environments, including the LEGO Foundation‚Äôs Playful Learning Online Project, Tsinghua‚Äôs Project X, and the Stanford ME310 Future Education Project. Currently, I‚Äôm investigating how intelligent agents can scaffold creative problem-solving and support child-centered, AI-augmented learning.

üîç I‚Äôm actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities, research collaborations, or other academic/industry roles related to HCI, AI & Education, or Creativity Support Tools.

[Mentigo: An Intelligent Agent for Mentoring Students in the Creative Problem Solving Process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14228)

**Siyu Zha**, Yujia Liu*, Chengbo Zheng, Jiaqi Xu, Fuze Yu, Jiangtao Gong*, Yingqing Xu
- To appear in the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '25)
- Creative Problem-Solving (CPS) promotes creative and critical thinking while enhancing real-world problem-solving skills, making it essential for middle school education. However, providing personalized mentorship in CPS projects at scale is challenging due to resource constraints and diverse student needs. To address this, we developed Mentigo, an AI-driven mentor agent designed to guide middle school students through the CPS process. Using a dataset of real classroom interactions, we encoded CPS task stages, adaptive guidance strategies, and personalized feedback mechanisms
to inform Mentigo‚Äòs dynamic mentoring framework powered by large language models (LLMs). A comparative experiment with 12 students and evaluations from five expert educators demonstrated improved student engagement, creativity, and task performance. Our findings highlight design implications for using LLM-based AI mentors to enhance CPS learning in educational environments.

[BrickSmart: Leveraging Generative AI to Support Children‚Äôs Spatial Language Learning in Family Block Play](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11138)

Yujia Liu*, **Siyu Zha***, Yuewen Zhang, Yanjin Wang, Yangming Zhang, Qi Xin, Lunyiu Nie, Chao Zhang, Yingqing Xu
- To appear in the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25) (üèÜ BEST PAPER HONORABLE MENTION)
- Block-building activities are crucial for developing children‚Äôs spatial
reasoning and mathematical skills, yet parents often lack the expertise to guide these activities effectively. BrickSmart, a pioneering system, addresses this gap by providing spatial language guidance through a structured three-step process: Discovery & Design, Build & Learn, and Explore & Expand. This system uniquely supports parents in 1) generating personalized block-building instructions, 2) guiding parents to teach spatial language during building and interactive play, and 3) tracking children‚Äôs learning progress, altogether enhancing children‚Äôs engagement and cognitive development. In a comparative study involving 12 parent-child pairs of children aged 6-8 years) for both experimental and control groups, BrickSmart demonstrated improvements in supportiveness, efficiency, and innovation, with a significant increase in children‚Äôs use of spatial vocabulary during block play, thereby offering an effective framework for fostering spatial language skills in children.

- As immersive social platforms like VRChat increasingly adopt generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it becomes critical to understand how community members perceive, negotiate, and utilize these tools. In this preliminary study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of VRChat-related Discord discussions, employing a deductive coding framework to identify key themes related to AI-assisted content creation, intellectual property disputes, and evolving community norms. Our findings offer preliminary insights into the complex interplay between the community's enthusiasm for AI-driven creativity and deep-rooted ethical and legal concerns. Users weigh issues of fair use, data ethics, intellectual property, and the role of community governance in establishing trust. By highlighting the tensions and trade-offs as users embrace new creative opportunities while seeking transparency, fair attribution, and equitable policies, this research offers valuable insights for designers, platform administrators, and policymakers aiming to foster responsible, inclusive, and ethically sound AI integration in future immersive virtual environments.

[COLP: Scaffolding Children‚Äôs Online Long-term Collaborative Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03226)

**Siyu Zha**, Yuanrong Tang, Jiangtao Gong*, Yingqing Xu
- Accepted by the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction (IJHCI).
- Nowadays, online collaborative learning and working are important for everyone, including children. However, children still face a lot of difficulties communicating and working together while online, which keeps them from engaging in long-term project-based teamwork. We aim to investigate online long-term collaborative learning opportunities to address this gap. We designed the Children‚Äôs Online Long-term Program (COLP), a 16-week online project-based learning program, as an educational intervention grounded in multiple learning theories for primary school students. This program was implemented with 67 upper primary school students (Grades 3‚Äì6, ages 8‚Äì13) from over five provinces in China. We found that this program could engage more than one-third of children in teamwork after a long-term study. Furthermore, we interview children and their parents to help us understand the communication channel, benefits, and challenges of this program. Interestingly, we discovered that parents play multiple roles in their children‚Äôs collaborative learning, particularly modeling and guiding the children‚Äôs collaborative skills. Given the lack of programs designed for children‚Äôs long-term online collaboration, this study may inspire intervention design in computer-supported collaborative learning communities.

[Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16159.pdf)

**Siyu Zha**, Yuehan Qiao, Qingyu Hu, Zhongsheng Li, Jiangtao Gong*, Yingqing Xu
- In submission to the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies (IJHCS).
- This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL settings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an exploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five design considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we developed an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional experiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can enhance every stage of PBL. We also discovered ambivalent perspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we explored the challenges and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and reflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational practice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into harnessing AI‚Äôs potential in child-centric educational settings.
